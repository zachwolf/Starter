# Starter

> Starting point for quick spin up of a project using [grunt-init][], Require.js, Jasmine/Karma, & SCSS/Compass.

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:zachwolf/Starter.git ~/.grunt-init/Starter
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init Starter
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._

Grunt-init template based on [grunt-init-jquery](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-jquery)
